# Project Profile
Project Title :	Helmet Detection Using YOLOv8

Objective :	The primary goal of this project is to create an automated system that can detect and classify helmets from images and videos. This system can be used in various applications such as traffic monitoring, workplace safety, and compliance enforcement to ensure that individuals are follow the safety regulations by wearing helmets. 

Platform : Google Colab: Utilized for its powerful computational resources and ease of use for running machine learning models.

Programming Language : 	Python: The primary programming language used for developing the helmet detection system.

Library :	OpenCV, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), cvzone	

Algorithms : YOLOv8: The latest version of the YOLO object detection algorithm. YOLOv8 is known for its high accuracy and speed in real-time performance, making it suitable for detecting helmets in various environments.

# Project Description
The project is designed to detect people who are either wearing helmets or not in an image. It uses a pre-trained YOLO model for image detection and classification. The model processes input images, identifies regions where helmets are present or absent, and highlights them with rectangles. The goal is to automate helmet detection, which could be used for safety monitoring in various industries. 

Project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. The project uses several libraries:
OpenCV : For image and video processing.
Cvzone : A library that simplifies the process of adding visual elements to images and videos, such as bounding boxes and labels.
YOLO : A pre-trained model, for identifying and classifying objects.
Ultralytics : Used for training and deploying YOLO models, specifically the YOLOv8 model. This library provides a high-level interface for working with YOLO models, making it easier to perform tasks such as object detection, and training.
